# lr-notebook

`lr-notebook` is a project notebook meant to facilitate organization & collaboration in research. It is meant to be adopted with only minimal changes to existing workflows, assuming that work is done in files and directories that are synced to cloud-based storage.

# Installation

1. Download the lr-notebook zip or fork this repo.
2. Install [Lektor](http://getlektor.com/)
3. Run Lektor.app, open the file nb.lektorproject in your lr-notebook folder, then the 'eye' button to view, and the ✎ button to edit. That's it!

# Live Demo

A static deployment of a lr-notebook is available [here](http://sdouglas.github.io/lr-notebook/).
